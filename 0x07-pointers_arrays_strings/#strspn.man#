NAME
       strspn, strcspn - search a string for a set of bytes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       size_t strspn(const char *s, const char *accept);

       size_t strcspn(const char *s, const char *reject);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strspn()  function  calculates the length (in bytes) of the
       initial segment of s which consists entirely of bytes in accept.

       The strcspn() function calculates the length of the initial seg‐
       ment of s which consists entirely of bytes not in reject.

RETURN VALUE
       The strspn() function returns the number of bytes in the initial
       segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept.

       The strcspn() function returns the number of bytes in  the  ini‐
       tial segment of s which are not in the string reject.
